Hello, my name is Thuy Dzung Nguyen. I have completed my MSc in Health Economics, and my bachelor's degree is in banking and finance. I have extensive experience working as a research assistant, a market access executive, and a consultant.
I am keen on improving my data analyzing skills, and to achieve that, I am attending online courses on Power BI, SQL, Python, and R. Additionally, I am utilising GitHub to showcase my work. I am excited about learning new models and visualization tools to create easily understandable reports and provide consultancy services.

Summary of my skills:

- Data modelling (including cost effectiveness, cost utility, cost benefit, budget impact, social impact models, etc.)
- Reports and policy advisory

Technical skills: Microsoft Excel, Stata, SQL, Python, R
